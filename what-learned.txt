C1. context api is used to pass data to multi level child component without props.
2. createContext() method is used to create context. is is used to the main 
    parent component. we need to {} import it from react. we need to use 
    createContext() outside of component method. we need to export this 
    context to read the context data.
    ==> 
        import {createContext} from 'react';

        export const CategoryContext = createContext();
        function App(){}

3. All the child component of main component where the context is created. 
    they are wrapped by Provider Component of Context. and passed the data on 
    props named value.
    ==>
        function App(){
            return(
                <CategoryContext.Provider value={'laptop'}>
                    <Header />
                    <Home />
                    <Shipment />
                </CategoryContext.Provider>
            );
        }

4. useContext() hook is used to read the context data from a child component. the arg is the Context.
    we need to import useContext from 'react'
    ==>
        import {useContext} from 'react';
        import {CategoryContext} from '../../App';

        function CategoryDetail(){
            const category = useContext(CategoryContext);
            return (
                <div>
                    <h1>Selected Category: {category}</h1>
                </div>
            );
        }
